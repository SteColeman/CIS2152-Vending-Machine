## CIS2152 Web Coding Vending Machine CLI Application

This is a simple command line vending machine built in year 2 of University. The brief was to design a working vending machine for users to interact with. There was 5 main requirements to this project. 1. View the list of products (each product must have a name & price). 2. View the amount of credit the user has. 3. Add credit. 4. Purchase a product. 5. Ask for a refund of their credit. in addition to these 5 requirements i also added in a add more money feature. This gives the uiser the option to add more credit to their balance if they dont have enough to make a purchase.
